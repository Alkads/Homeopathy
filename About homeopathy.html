    <h2>About Homoeopathy</h2>
    <p>In 1796, German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, founded the 
system of Homoeopathy, which is based on the principle that health 
is maintained by an internal vital force which governs the healthy / 
“normal” functions of the body and disease is the derangement of this 
vital energy. The derangement is manifested in the form of disturbed 
functions or abnormalities in the form of mental and physical 
symptoms first and pathology in tissues and organs thereafter.</p>
    
    <p>Based on the natural law of Similars, Homeopathic medicines are 
prepared by the process of potentization. Potentization is a process 
that involves successive dilutions and succussions (vigorous shaking); 
it was first introduced by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann himself, who 
observed that solutions of substances that have undergone this 
process have a biological effect in humans - with therapeutic 
evidence. </p>
    
    <p>To date, numerous homeopathic remedies have been used, and they 
are very well documented; they are derived from a wide variety of 
substances that are potentized to obtain their healing properties.</p>
    
    <p>Homoeopathy in my view is purely scientific because it is based on a 
natural law, it is a system arrived at by inductive and deductive logic, 
observation and experiments, and proven effective in millions of 
patients and their ailments.</p>
    
    <p>Homoeopathy is also an art, art of examining the personality of the 
unique individual, and choosing the right remedy for the unique 
symptoms of disease.</p>
    
    <p>I would like to describe Homoeopathy as the most gentle, natural, 
permanent, and holistic cure for many diseases.</p>

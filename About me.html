    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I describe myself as a simple doctor who is passionate about seeing 
people grow in terms of good health, not only physical, but mental, 
intellectual, social, and spiritual, moving towards higher individual 
goals and purposes. I am a qualified BHMS, and I am dedicated to 
Homoeopathy. I firmly believe in Homoeopathy because I have seen 
and experienced beautiful cures with Homoeopathic medicines. At 
the same time, I also strongly believe in "human energy," - the idea 
that human energy is very naturally happy, resilient, flexible, stress-
resistant, powerful, and almost invincible and that disease happens 
only when we have ignorance and fear. So, it turns out "Knowing is 
the antidote to disease," - the antidote to ignorance and fear. My 
favourite line is Aristotle's quote "Knowing yourself is the beginning 
of all wisdom." Knowing your "self," your desires, honestly watching 
what your actual inner desires are, and understanding their relevance 
in your actions, your plans, your choices - is the key to understand 
good health and stress-free living.</p>
    
    <p>I am additionally qualified with a certificate in Advanced 
Homoeopathy. I owe my success in Homoeopathy to my teacher, Dr. 
Rajan Sankaran. Advanced Homoeopathy incorporates the latest 
research on the new sensation method which improves the "art of 
Homoeopathic practice" making it more accurate and quicker to 
prescribe.</p>
    
    <p>My passion for witnessing personal growth in people naturally makes 
me a counsellor. I owe my easy, natural, and effective counseling 
skills to my mentor, Anagha Adoni, MA Psych., of Anvay Psychological 
Health, with whom I completed a certificate course in Clinical 
Psychology. I believe every problem has a solutionâ€”sometimes it lies 
within us, and sometimes it is found in the situation. The key is to 
recognize the difference. Often, we try to change the external world 
when the real change needs to happen within. Other times, we blame 
ourselves and remain passive when we should be taking control of the 
situation. And sometimes, we are simply confused about what's really 
going on.</p>
    
    <p>Being aligned with my higher purpose, I also aim to bring about a 
hope in humanity that "health does not come at a very big cost," that 
"every human being has the right to medical care and a healthy life, 
regardless of their economic background." Yes! there are alternatives 
to expensive commercial treatments.</p>
